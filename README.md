# SelfAvoidingRandomWalk
input: A lattice or grid n*n </br>
output: Probability of Escape! and Dead End! </br>
problem definition: In mathematics, a self-avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once.</br>
---> I use Monte Carlo Method </br>
1- Start from center.</br>
2- Randomly go to a neighboring intersection, but do not cross any intersection twice.
